I set this blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) after reading about it on [Tom Critchlow's Site](https://tomcritchlow.com/) . Once you have a [Github account](http://www.github.com), follow the instructions by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and you will be up and running in mintues.
