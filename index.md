# Matt Zimmerman

Hi. I'm Matt Zimmerman. I'm a product manager with experience in web-publishing platforms, APIs, and XML content.

Here are some interesting projects I have worked on:

## At The Springer Publishing Company
* Launched [Springer Publishing Company's](https://www.springerpub.com/) first eBook and ejournal platform [Springer Publishing Connect](http://connect.springerpub.com)
* Integrated SalesForce and Springer Publishng Connect so sales reps could grant instant ebook access to prospective textbook adopters, replacing the costly and slow hard copy via the mail process.
* Deployed an API that ran hourly imports of customer transaction data from four separate ecommerce systems into Salesforce. This replaced a weekly manual process and lead to a doubling of marketing email open and click rates.
* Used [Microsoft Power Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps) to automate a book cover image upload process.

## At John Wiley and Sons
* Launched the first "Society Hub" with publishiing partner the [American Geophysical Union](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/) 
* Piloted a project integrating [FigShare](https://figshare.com/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash), and other data repositories into Wiley author and publishing workflows

## At IEEE 
* Improved the "search by author" feature by overseeing an "author disambiguation" project (i.e. recognizing that J.A. Smith, John Adams Smith, and John A. Smith all refer to a single author and should be included in the search results)
* Launched an Open Access Megajournal, [IEEE Access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6287639)

## At UTSW Medical Center Library
* With funding from the National Library of Medicine launched the [Medical Milestones in Dallas](https://utswlibrary.omeka.net/exhibits/show/milestones/intro) web exhibit.

## At New York University
* Devolped a digital edition of the *Speeches and Writngs of Margaret Sanger* with the [Margaret Sangers Papers Project](https://m-sanger.org/welcome). The system allowed for ingestion of XML documents that were parsed into a MYSQL database for search and retrieval. The [current version](https://m-sanger.org/digi) of the project has since been updated to newer technology.

## Some other things I have experience with
XML, XSLT, BaseX, Oxygen, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, Google Tag Manager, Microsoft Power Apps, Azure, Sharepoint, Jira, Trello
