# Matt Zimmerman

Hi. I'm Matt Zimmerman. I'm a product manager with experience in web-publishing platforms, APIs, and XML content.

Here are some interesting projects I have worked on:

**At The Springer Publishing Company**

* Laucnhed Springer Publishing Company's first eBook and ejournal platform [Springer Publishng Connect](http://connect.springerpub.com)
* With [Dylan Wooters](https://dylanwooters.com/index.html) integrated SalesForce and Springer Publishng Connect so sales reps could grant instant ebook access to prospective text book adopters, replacing the costly and slow hard copy via the mail process.
* Also with Dylan Wooters, deployed and API that did hourly imports of customer transaction data from four seperate ecommerce systems into Salesforce. This replaced a weekly manual process and lead to a dobubling of marketing email open and click rates.
* Used Microsoft Power Apps to automate a book cover image upload process where editoral assitants neeed only to upload images to a Sharepoint folder. The Power App automation validated the file type and naming covention, uploaded the image to an Azure media server and emailed the URL of the image to the Editorial Assistant to be enetered into a content managemnt system. This replaced a process where files where emailed directly to our webmaster and manually added to the site.

**At John Wiley and Sons**
* Launched the first "Society Hub" with publishiing partner the [American Geophysical Union](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/) 
* Piloted a project integrating FigShare, Dryad, and other data repositories into Wiley author and publishing workflows

**At IEEE**
* Author disambiguaion project
* Open Access Megajournal project

**At UTSW Medical Center Library**
* Dallas Medical Images project

**At New York University**
* Margaret Sanger Papers Project
