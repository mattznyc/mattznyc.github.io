About two years ago I took a work break. My parter and I left our jobs and moved to Albania (where she is from originally) to live a different lifestyle, at least from a short while. It was great. We relaxed, traveled, ate good food and met great people. Now I am back on the job market applying for Product and Project Manager Roles.

This is also a chance for me to brush up on old and learn some new skills, which I will be blogging about here. I hope you enjoy.
