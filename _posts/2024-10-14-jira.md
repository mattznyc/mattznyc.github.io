In my first product owner role at [IEEE](https"//www.ieee.org) we used (Jira)[https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira] to manage our scrum workflow. I always liked it, and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), but in later roles I used [Pivitol Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/), which is now being sunsetted and [Trello](https://www.atlassian.com/software/trello). Many of the product owner/manager roles I have seen list Jira experience as a requirement, so I have been brushing up on my skills at Atlassian. They have a number of [good, and free, learning paths](https://university.atlassian.com/student/collection/850385-learning-paths).
