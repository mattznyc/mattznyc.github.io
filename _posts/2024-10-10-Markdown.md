 One of the benefits of using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the ability to use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Markdown is a simplified markup language (get it?) that is then converted into HTML by Jekyl.

Jonathan Mcglone covers the basics in this [Guide to Github Pages and Jekyll](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and you can [download a cheatsheet here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip).
