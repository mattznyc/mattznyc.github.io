The first thing I decided to relearn was [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is what you are looking at right now. Github allows you to make simple static webpages at no cost. You create the pages and add them to your repository just like any Github file. Jekyll is a static site generator that you can use on Github to make life a little easier by allowing templates so you only have to make things like headers and footers once. Jekyll also allows you to use Markdown, which is the next things I learned.

This may sound like a lot of work at first but if you follow [Jonathan Mcglone's guide[(https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) here you should be up and running in no time.

Enjoy!
