# Matt Zimmerman

Hi. I'm Matt Zimmerman. I'm a product manager with experience in web-publishing platforms, APIs, and XML content.

Here are some interesting projects I have worked on:

## At The Springer Publishing Company
* Laucnhed [Springer Publishing Company's](https://www.springerpub.com/) first eBook and ejournal platform [Springer Publishng Connect](http://connect.springerpub.com)
* With [Dylan Wooters](https://dylanwooters.com/index.html) integrated SalesForce and Springer Publishng Connect so sales reps could grant instant ebook access to prospective text book adopters, replacing the costly and slow hard copy via the mail process.
* Also with [Dylan Wooters](https://dylanwooters.com/index.html), deployed an API that ran hourly imports of customer transaction data from four seperate ecommerce systems into Salesforce. This replaced a weekly manual process and lead to a dobubling of marketing email open and click rates.
* Used [Microsoft Power Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps) to automate a book cover image upload process.

## At John Wiley and Sons
* Launched the first "Society Hub" with publishiing partner the [American Geophysical Union](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/) 
* Piloted a project integrating [FigShare](https://figshare.com/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash), and other data repositories into Wiley author and publishing workflows

## At IEEE 
* 
* Open Access Megajournal project

## At UTSW Medical Center Library
